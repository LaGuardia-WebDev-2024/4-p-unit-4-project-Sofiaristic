  <h1>Sofia's Unoffical Guide to HOGWARTS</h1>
  
<h2> You've been accepted dearest witch or wizard!</h2>

  <h3>Your journey: </h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Your journey will begin at platform <strong>9 3/4, </strong>between platforms 9 and 10 at <strong> King's Cross Station</strong>. 
    Without slowling down you'll push through the barrier. (Dont use a flying car to get to Hogwarts please) 
    You will then see the <strong>Scarlet Hogwarts express</strong> and there your trip begins.</p>

  <p> During the train ride meet new witches and wizards and try some of the wizarding world's delights- Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans</p>
  <p> You'll then see a giant man,<strong> Hagrid </strong>call all the first years and youll follow him to the boats to cross the Great Lake and see the magnificent Hogwarts</p>
  <br><br>

  <h3>The Sorting Ceremony:</h3>
  <hr>
  <p> In the <strong>Great Hall</strong>, you will see long table with candles flosting in the air and above you what seesm to be a night sky. Bustling with hundreds of witches and wizards the sorting ceremony will begin. 
    The <strong>Sorting hat </strong>will be placed on your head and then choose your house: 
   <ul><strong>
    <li> Gryffindor — For the brave and daring</li>
    <li> Hufflepuff — For the kind and true</li>
    <li> Ravenclaw — For the wise and witty</li>
    <li> Slytherin — For the ambitious and clever</li></strong>
  </ul> 
  <img src="https://static0.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Hogwarts-Houses-(1).jpg" width="600"> 
    <p> You now belong to a house, go sit and meet your new friends</p>
  </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3>Life at Hogwarts</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Youll enjoy or get tricked by the moving staircases, talking portrriats especially yhe fat lady and see the ghosts of hogwarts (Dont walk into them) </p>

  <p> 
    <ul> Some classes you will have will be:
      <li> <strong>Transfiguration </strong> with Professor McGonagall- turning animals in water goblets</li>
      <li> <strong>Potions</strong> with Professor Snape</li>
      <li> <strong>Charms </strong>with Professor Flitwick — learning Wingardium Leviosa</li>
      <li> <strong>Defense Against the Dark Arts</strong>- this year its Professor Lupin</li>
      <li> <strong>Herbology</strong> with Professor Sprout- learning about Mandrakes</li>
  </ul>
    </p>
  <br><br>

<h3>Feasts and Holidays</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Feasts are held in the <strong>Great Hall</strong> sitting with eveyone you know trying tasty treats like roast chicken, treacle tart, pumpkin juice and Cauldron cakes. </p>
  <p>At Halloween the Great Hall brings floating pumpkins and a spookier vibe to the castle.</p>
  <p> <strong>Christmas at Hogwarts is my favirote.</strong> They put a great big tree all decorated, hold the<strong> Yule ball </strong>and the snow at Hogwarts is out of this world. If your lucky go into Hogsemade and try some winter delights and Butterbeer and if your up for some fun see the <strong>Forbidden Forest</strong> coasted in snow and silver. (be careful to not get caught) </p>

<h3>The Shadows and Secrets: </h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Hogwarts is full of dark corners and secrets and only ones who are up to the task should explore. Theres the <strong>Room of Requirement </strong>that only appears when needed. Next theres <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> hidden beneath the school but thats up to you to find.</p>
  <p> Important note: If you ever find the <strong>Marauders Map</strong>, enjoy its charm, find the secret passages, and keep a look out for odd people.</p>
  <br><br>

<h3>End of Term:</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>At the end of the year the <strong>House Cup</strong> is fianlly awarded to the House with the most points tallied for bravery, intellect, kindness, and cunning. The banners then change to the winning House’s colors, and the castle bursts into cheers.</p>
  <p> then its until next year until the fun starts all over again but now you are one of the Hogwarts family.</p>
  <br><br>

<h2> Good luck and have the most magical time!</h2>  
<p> Enjoy the Felix Felicis or Liquid Luck. Use it when you truly need it.</p>
